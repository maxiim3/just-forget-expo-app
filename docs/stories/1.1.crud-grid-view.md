# Story 1.1: CRUD in Grid View

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user viewing my thoughts in the Grid view,
**I want** to tap on a card to edit it and long-press for quick actions,
**so that** I can manage my entries without switching to the Capture view.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Tapping a Grid card opens the existing EditModal for that entry
2. Long-pressing a Grid card shows a context menu with Archive and Delete options
3. Archive action moves the entry to the archived section
4. Delete action permanently removes the entry (with confirmation)
5. Actions work on both active and archived entries
6. No regression in existing Grid view layout and styling
7. Visual feedback on tap and long-press (press state)

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Add tap handler to GridCard (AC: 1, 7)
  - [ ] Import `setEditingEntry` from store in `grid.tsx`
  - [ ] Add `onPress={() => setEditingEntry(entry)}` to GridCard's Pressable
  - [ ] Verify EditModal opens with correct entry content

- [ ] Task 2: Import and render EditModal in GridScreen (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Import `EditModal` from `@/components/cards/EditModal`
  - [ ] Add `<EditModal />` to GridScreen render (outside ScrollView)
  - [ ] Test edit flow: tap → edit → save → verify update

- [ ] Task 3: Implement long-press context menu (AC: 2, 3, 4, 7)
  - [ ] Add `onLongPress` handler to GridCard's Pressable
  - [ ] Create context menu state in GridScreen (activeMenuEntryId)
  - [ ] Build simple context menu component (Archive / Delete buttons)
  - [ ] Position menu near the pressed card
  - [ ] Add backdrop to dismiss menu

- [ ] Task 4: Wire up Archive action (AC: 3, 5)
  - [ ] Import `archiveEntry` from store
  - [ ] Connect Archive button to `archiveEntry(entry.id)`
  - [ ] Close menu after action
  - [ ] Verify entry moves to archived section

- [ ] Task 5: Wire up Delete action with confirmation (AC: 4, 5)
  - [ ] Import `deleteEntry` from store
  - [ ] Add confirmation Alert before delete
  - [ ] Connect Delete button to `deleteEntry(entry.id)` after confirmation
  - [ ] Close menu after action
  - [ ] Verify entry is removed from list

- [ ] Task 6: Add visual press feedback (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Add `pressed` state styling to GridCard (opacity or scale)
  - [ ] Use Pressable's style function: `style={({ pressed }) => [...]}`

- [ ] Task 7: Verify no regressions (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Test Grid layout remains 2-column
  - [ ] Test archived section styling (opacity-60) unchanged
  - [ ] Test empty state still displays correctly

## Dev Notes

### Existing Components to Reuse
- **EditModal** (`components/cards/EditModal.tsx`): Already built, uses `editingEntry` from store
- **GridCard** (`app/(tabs)/grid.tsx:23-39`): Has Pressable wrapper, needs onPress/onLongPress

### Store Methods Available (lib/store.ts)
- `setEditingEntry(entry: Entry | null)` - Opens EditModal with entry
- `archiveEntry(id: string)` - Sets `archived: true` on entry
- `deleteEntry(id: string)` - Removes entry from state

### File Locations
- Grid view: `app/(tabs)/grid.tsx`
- EditModal: `components/cards/EditModal.tsx`
- Store: `lib/store.ts`
- Entry type: `lib/supabase.ts`

### Context Menu Options
Simple inline implementation recommended (no external library needed):
- Use React Native `Modal` or absolute positioned View
- Archive and Delete buttons with icons
- Dismiss on backdrop tap

### Styling Patterns (from existing code)
- Border: `border-4 border-primary`
- Rounded: `rounded-sketch` or `rounded-sketchLg`
- Background: `bg-surface`
- Font: `font-caveat` (body), `font-marker` (headers)
- Colors: `text-primary`, `text-secondary`, `bg-muted`

## Testing

### Manual Testing Required
- [ ] Tap card → EditModal opens with correct content
- [ ] Edit content → Save → Content updated in grid
- [ ] Long-press card → Context menu appears
- [ ] Archive from menu → Entry moves to archived section
- [ ] Delete from menu → Confirmation → Entry removed
- [ ] Dismiss menu by tapping outside
- [ ] Test on archived entries (same behavior expected)

### Platforms to Test
- Web (primary)
- iOS Simulator / Expo Go
- Android Emulator / Expo Go
